# The address in RAM of the memory buffer dedicated to the SMC. The following constraints apply to this address: 
#    - It is a physical address (the addressed RAM must be physically contiguous),
#    - It must be aligned on a 1MB memory boundary,
#    - The addressed RAM must not be addressed by the Operating System during execution,
#    - This memory area must not be powered off during power management activities.
# For instance, if 128MB of SDRAM is available on the device starting at address 0x80000000, the boot parameters of the Operating System must be configured to use the first 126MB and 
# SE.SDPInit.SdramBkExtStorageAddr has to be set to 0x87E00000 (0x80000000 + 126MB) as conjointly the SMC and SE needs to 2MB in SDRAM.
#
# For Motorola Endive (256MB device), it has to be set to 0x8FE00000
SE.SDPInit.SdramBkExtStorageAddr: 0x8FE00000

#
# The SMC Secure Storage relies on 4 files stored in the Main OS Environment for the effective storage on the device of the protected data 
# (all the security properties of the SMC Secure Storage are managed in the Secure Environment):
# - a general purpose storage file (used through the Secure Storage Normal World API, i.e. the SSTxxxx functions, and the SSDI SFilexxx functions). 
# - a mandatory system keystore file (used through the PKCS#11 normal world API with the CKV_TOKEN_SYSTEM token and the CKV_TOKEN_SYSTEM_SHARE token and the PKCS#11 of SSDI)
# - an optional user keystore file  (used through the PKCS#11 normal world API with the CKV_TOKEN_USER token and the CKV_TOKEN_USER_SHARE token
# - a mandatory Monotonic Counter file: it contains the monotonic counter values associated with each of the 3 files above. It is advised to store, if possible, this file in a separated physical partition as the 3 above files.
#
# The path of each of the above files has to be specified in the following parameters:
#
# Absolute pathname and name of the general purpose storage file
filesystem.storage.fileName:  /data/tpapi/storage.bin
# Absolute pathname and name of the system keystore file
filesystem.keystore.fileName: /pds/security/system.bin
# Absolute pathname and name of the user keystore file
filesystem.keystore.user.fileName: /data/tpapi/user.bin
# Absolute pathname and name of the Monotonic Counter file
filesystem.mc.fileName: /pds/security/counter.bin
