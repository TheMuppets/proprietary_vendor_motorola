This XML file declares which system packages should be initially installed for new users based on
their user type. All system packages on the device should ideally have an entry in an xml file
(keyed by its manifest name).

Base user-types (every user will be at least one of these types) are:
 - SYSTEM    (user 0)
 - FULL      (any non-profile human user)
 - PROFILE   (profile human user)
the precise meaning of which is defined in
frameworks/base/core/java/android/content/pm/UserInfo.java.

Changes to the whitelist during system updates can result in installing additional system packages
to pre-existing users, but cannot uninstall pre-existing system packages from pre-existing users.
